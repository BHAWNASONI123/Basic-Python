        "# Que 1- what is python and why is it popular?\n",
        "# Ans #  Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1991.\n",
        "      #  Its syntax is clean and resembles plain English, making it easy to read and write.\n",
        "      #  It is used in various fields, including: Web development,data analysis,AI,Scientific computing,Game development.\n",
        "      #  Cross-Platform: Runs on multiple operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n",
        "      #  Popular in Trending Fields: Widely used in areas like AI, ML, and data science, which are in high demand.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Que 2-  What is an interpreter in python ?\n",
        "# Ans  -  Python's interpreter supports dynamic execution, meaning it processes code at runtime instead of creating a separate compiled file.\n",

        "# Que 3-  What are pre-defined keywords in Python ?\n",
        "# Ans  -  pre-defined keywords in Python are reserved words that have specific meanings There are some examples.and: Logical AND operator.\n",
        "\n",
        "# or: Logical OR operator.\n",
        "# not: Logical NOT operator.\n",
        "# if: Conditional statement.\n",
        "# else: Executes if the condition in the if statement is false.\n",
        "# elif: Else if – checks another condition if the previous one is false.\n",
        "# for: Looping construct.\n",
        "# while: Looping construct based on a condition.\n",

        "\n",
        "# Que 4-  Can keywords be used as variable names ?\n",
        "# Ans  -  No keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python.\n",
        "         # This is because they are reserved words in the Python programming language with specific meanings and purposes in the syntax.\n",

        "\n",
        "# Que 6-  Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable ?\n",
        "# Ans  - Lists are designed to be flexible and modifiable. They allow adding, removing, or changing elements after their creation.\n",
        "#      - Tuples are designed to represent collections of data that shouldn't change, such as coordinates or configuration values.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Que 7-  What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python ?\n",
        "# Ans  - == checks if values are the same.\n",
        "#         is checks if two variables point to the same object in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Que 8-  What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "# Ans  - In Python, logical operators are used to combine conditional statements. The main logical operators are:\n",
        "\n",
        "#and – Returns True if both conditions are True.\n",
        "#or – Returns True if at least one of the conditions is True.\n",
        "#not – Reverses the result, returns True if the condition is False and vice versa.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Que 9-  What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "# Ans  -  Type casting (or Type Conversion) in Python is the process of converting one data type into another manually..\n",
        "\n",
        "# Que 10-  What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "# Ans  - Implicit Casting: Automatically done by Python when needed.\n",
        "#        Explicit Casting: Done manually using functions like int(), float(), str(), etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Que 11-  What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "# Ans  -   Purpose: Conditional statements enable a program to make decisions and execute different code blocks based on conditions.\n",
        "#          Common Statements: if, else, and elif are used for decision-making and controlling program flow.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Que 12-  How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "# Ans  -   f-elif-else statement: Checks multiple conditions sequentially.\n",

        "# Que 13 - What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "# Ans  -    A loop is used for executing a block of statements repeatedly until a particular condition is satisfied.\n",
        "#           There are two types of loops:\n",
        "#           for loop: Best when you know how many times you want to iterate (like looping through a list or range).\n",
        "#           while loop: Best when you need to repeat something as long as a certain condition is True.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Que 14 - Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "# Ans  -    Imagine you're building a program that repeatedly asks the user for their password until they enter the correct one. You don’t know how many attempts the user will need, so a while loop is more suitable in this case.\n"
